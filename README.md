# BlackSky Git Resources
This repository contains a list of resources for learning (and teaching) how we
use Git at BlackSky. The resources are as follows:

+ `lesson_plan.md` - Speaking notes for a crash course in Git
+ `lesson_slides.html` - A simple set of slides to accompany the lesson plan above
+ `index.html` - A a common file for people to practice commits (and conflict resolution)

## Self Study
If you are interested in teaching yourself git, the [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
tutorial is a very good one that has been kicking around for over half a decade
now.
